   is "" if name=value pair parsed before any section heading. name:value
   pairs are also supported as a concession to Python's ConfigParser.

   pointer as well as section, name, and value (data only valid for duration
   of handler call). Handler should return nonzero on success, zero on error.

   Returns 0 on success, line number of first error on parse error (doesn't
   stop on first error), or -1 on file open error.
