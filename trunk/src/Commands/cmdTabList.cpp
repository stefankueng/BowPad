OVERVIEW

Clicking the tab list button causes BP to display a menu of tabs.

Ideally the tab list would be built on demand to ensure it remains
in sync. But we don't know how to make the ribbon query for a new list
each time the menu is clicked, it prefers to cache it.
That means we have to build the tab list when the ribbon asks for it
and track events which indicate the tab list is out of sync and
then invalidate the tab list then so BP re-queries for a new list.
So ideally we'd just build it on demand and trash it when the user
dismisses/cancels the list without making a selection.

But there appears to be no InvalidateOnCancel type ribbon event that
I am aware of to allow for that.
Windows 8 has supports IUIEventLogger and UI_EVENTTYPE that would seem
to be what we want but this isn't documented as working on Windows 7.

A workaround might have been to invalidate our list once the user
begins working in the editor again, but this isn't totally
reliable and leaves the user looking at an empty menu sometimes
so that approach hasn't been taken.

When a future solution becomes available it is likely
we want to call InvalidateTabList on the appropriate event type.

A better solution as described above may be possible, at least in the
future, but the current solution of tracking events and maintaining the list
seems to work pretty effectively for now. It's at least in fashion
with how other commands work. There is a chance that bugs and/or failing
to trap all the right events might make this solution not 100% bullet proof
but it seems to be working ok and all commands currently operate under these
circumstances anyway.
